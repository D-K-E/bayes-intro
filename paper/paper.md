# Summary

Probabilistic Graphical models are a marriage between Graphs as in Graph
Theory, and Probability as in statistics and probability theory. We aim to
concertize this conceptual marriage by using object oriented paradigms. Most
importantly, probabilistic graphical models are a general framework which
underlies most, if not all of, the popular probabilistic structures that help
with different artificial intelligence tasks.
