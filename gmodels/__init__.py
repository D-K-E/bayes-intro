The library is focused on analysis than io. Everything is implemented from 
scratch. Only standard library is used for now. 
I might add numpy and cython later on if the performance becomes an issue 
(it most likely will ...). Very experimental stuff use it at your own risk.

This library was first intended to be an introduction to bayesian statistics.
Now, I decided to make something more flexible and more focused on graphs.

However some of the bits in the old code might come in handy later on,
so I am saving them under legacy for now. The old code base uses, numpy and
pandas as well.

The main objects of the library are:

    - Graph in \ref graphpage

    - Edge in \ref edgepage

    - Node in \ref nodepage
