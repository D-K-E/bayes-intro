# bayes-intro

Bayesian statistics related bits and pieces all with basic libraries like
pandas and numpy, maybe some matplotlib here and there to help visualization.

- `BasicNaiveBayes.py` introduces concepts related to naive bayesian
  classification.

- `NaiveBayes.py` abstracts away some of the concepts introduced above.
